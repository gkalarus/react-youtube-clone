# react-youtube-clone

A simple video player application built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React.js library and YouTube API. At the top of the screen we've got a search bar, on the right hand side we have a list of some videos, on the main part of the screen we have a video player and underneath it a video title and description of the currently playing video. When the user types into the search bar it's going to update the little video list on the right hand side on the fly. When the user clicks on a video it will start playing automatically inside the main video player section.
